## Generalized Nested Spatial Model (GSNM)

$$
y = \rho_{Lag} W y + \Chi\beta + W\Chi\gamma + \mu,
\mu = \rho_{Err} W \mu + \xi
$$

where $y$ is an $(N \times 1)$ vector of observations on a response variable taken at each of $N$ locations,$W$is a spatial weight matrix, which is a non-negative matrix of size $N \times N$, $\Chi$ is an $(N \times k)$ matrix of covariates, $\beta$ is a $(k \times 1)$ vector of parameters, $\mu$ is an $(N \times 1)$ spatially autocorrelated disturbance vector, $\xi$ is an $(N \times 1)$ vector of independent and identically distributed disturbances, $\rho_{Lag}$ and $\rho_{Err}$ is a scalar spatial parameter. $\gamma$ is a $(k' \times 1)$ vector of parameters. $k'$ defines the subset of the intercept and covariates, often $k' = k-1$ when using row standardised spatial weights and omitting the spatially lagged intercept.
